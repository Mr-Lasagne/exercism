Given a 3 x 4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces, determine which number is
represented, or whether it is garbled.

## Step One

To begin with, convert a simple binary font to a string containing 0 or 1.

The binary font uses pipes and underscores, four rows high and three columns
wide.

```text
     _   #
    | |  # zero.
    |_|  #
         # the fourth row is always blank
```

Is converted to "0"

```text
         #
      |  # one.
      |  #
         # (blank fourth row)
```

Is converted to "1"

If the input is the correct size, but not recognizable, your program should
return '?'

If the input is the incorrect size, your program should return an error.

## Step Two

Update your program to recognize multi-character binary strings, replacing
garbled numbers with ?

## Step Three

Update your program to recognize all numbers 0 through 9, both individually and
as part of a larger string.

```text
 _
 _|
|_

```

Is converted to "2"

```text
      _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _  #
    | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| | # decimal numbers.
    ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_| #
                                 # fourth line is always blank
```

Is converted to "1234567890"

## Step Four

Update your program to handle multiple numbers, one per line. When converting
several lines, join the lines with commas.

```text
    _  _
  | _| _|
  ||_  _|

    _  _
|_||_ |_
  | _||_|

 _  _  _
  ||_||_|
  ||_| _|

```

Is converted to "123,456,789".

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception][raising-exceptions]. When you
do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate
what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps
significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error
source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in
error types][base-classes], but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise
statement][the-raise-statement] to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `board()`
function receives malformed input. The tests will only pass if you both `raise`
the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the
`exception` type:

```python
# when the rows aren't multiples of 4
raise ValueError("Number of input lines is not a multiple of four")

# when the columns aren't multiples of 3
raise ValueError("Number of input columns is not a multiple of three")
```
